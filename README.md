# GreenPot
GreenPot is the codename for my submission for the 2024 FBLA Coding and Programming event. I chose this name because school partners usually provide some value to the school in return for the advertising. I used the adjective "Green" to symbolize the value that the partners provide. "Pot" refers to all the partners being stored or contained in a single place. Hence, the codename for this project is **GreenPot**.
# Overview
The purpose of this application is to store information on partners for the Career and Technical Department of my school. The application allows members of the Career and Technical Department to create accounts to store their data as well as view the data of others. Users can create, view, update, and delete partners. They can store contact information in the form of email, phone number, and individual along with the type of organization and the resources that they provide. 

This program enables school faculty to easily store important data while maintaining a level of security between users. Users can also generate downloadable reports of partner data that may find use outside of the context of the application.
# Design
To design this application, I followed a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
## Understanding Requirements
The requirements of this application are very straightforward. This left room for additional functionality. The main function is storage, but I added CRUD operations
